It's a great feeling when you find an incredible artist with a discography amounting to only *one* single. That's right, one.

You're probably wondering how I can even judge an artist with only a couple recordings to listen to! The truth is, a couple of recordings is all it took for me. Just this video was enough to make me shed a tear. If you feel nothing while watching this then I am sorry, <b style="color: black; text-shadow: 0px 0px 6px red">YOU HAVE NO SOUL</b>. Take a listen and have some tissues ready.

**I'M NOT CRYING, YOU ARE.**

Abbey Smith, better known as Yebba, is an up and coming artist who's been praised by high profile names for her soulful chops that have captivated listeners from all over. She recorded a song with Sam Smith for his latest album, appeared on some live PJ Morton music, and even backed Chance the Rapper during a spectacular SNL performance of "Same Drugs", where I would argue she _stole_ the show. But what's intrigued me more about Yebba is not just her vocal chops, but the amount of adversity that she's faced.

About a week after she performed her song "My Mind" in NYC, she intimately shared with her fans that her mother committed suicide. This girl has no doubt been to hell and back. We can't comprehend the kind of pain that she's faced, but we can gain an insight on the kind of soul that drives Abbey in creating and sharing her music moving forward. She performed her debut single "Evergreen" in the same church where she sat beside her mother every week.

*There is beauty in brokenness*. 

And one can only imagine what she has in store for us.
