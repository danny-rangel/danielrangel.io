It's a bittersweet feeling when you find an incredible artist with a discography amounting to only *one* single. That's right, one.

You're probably wondering how I can even judge an artist with only a couple recordings to listen to! The truth is, a couple of recordings is all it took. Hell, just this first video was enough to send a tear rolling down my cheek. And if this does nothing to you, then I am sorry, **YOU HAVE NO SOUL**. Take a listen.

Believe me now? 

Abbey Smith, better known as Yebba, is an up and coming artist oozing with raw talent. She's been praised by high profile names for her soulful chops that have captivated listeners from all over, and even backed Chance the Rapper during a spectacular SNL performance of "Same Drugs". But what's intrigued me more about Yebba is not just her vocal chops, but the amount of hurt that she's been through while still pushing through.

About a week after she performed her song "My Mind" in NYC, she intimately shared with her fans that her mother committed suicide. In no way can we comprehend the kind of pain that she faced, but we can gain a perspective on the kind of heart Abbey has in creating and sharing her music moving forward. She performed her debut single "Evergreen" in the same church where she sat beside her mother every week.

*There is beauty in brokenness*. 

And one can only imagine what she has in store for us for the future.
