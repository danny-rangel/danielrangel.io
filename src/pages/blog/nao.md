Nao is a singer/songwriter from London known for her sugar coated voice and blend of funk, electronic, r&b...you get the point. She has a unique sound! She's been steadily giving us more music in the form of EPs and a couple albums, and her most recent album "Saturn" was definitely a gem.

"Saturn" is based on the Saturn return, which is astrology mumbo jumbo for a point when the planet Saturn returns to the same spot it was at your birth. It technically doesn't reach the same spot until around 29 or 30 years old, but the so called effects of reaching adulthood, being faced with responsilbilities, challenges, etc. are said to begin around the age of 27. I'm getting pretty close to that age, so I'll be sure to save my quarter life crisis until then and play this album in full while questioning my interpersonal relationships.

I've been playing this performance nonstop for the last week now. Nao performs two tracks from her album accompanied by a killer band and string section. If you know me, you know I _love_ strings, so that little interlude in between the two songs made me super happy.


She's joined by Kwabs who sings in the studio version of the song "Saturn". His voice is something that's hard to replicate, so it really could not have been done any other way. I'm sure you did a double take if this was your first time hearing his voice. Check him out later if you have a chance because he has some good music and killer pipes!


If you're still just reading this and haven't pressed play yet, __WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?__

And if you've already watched it and are amazed, go listen to her album and be __TRANSFORMED__.
