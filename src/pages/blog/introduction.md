*"The ability to speak does not make you intelligent"*

---

I will preface this by saying that I by no means have a way with words. I apologize in advance.

Writing is one of those things that I enjoy, but don't consider myself particularly good at. Hence, I've decided to start a blog with the intention of getting better at collecting and expressing my own thoughts. 

For those of you who actually care to read, know that I **APPRECIATE** you. I plan on talking a _lot_ about music, and hopefully just as much about personal projects, code, and life in general.

Thanks for reading &hearts;
