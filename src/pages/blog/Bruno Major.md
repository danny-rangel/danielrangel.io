To me, A Song For Every Moon was an evolutionary experience. Bruno Major released this album one song at a time, which gave me the opportunity to savor each song. And boy, was I glad that I caught it right from the start. 

The first song, "Wouldn't Mean a Thing" begins with a beautiful collection of vocal layers harmonizing with one another as Bruno hits you with some complex melodies that complement the underlying layers. I remember thinking to myself, "This is the first song?!" I anticipated a situation where the artist was probably releasing their best song first to attract listeners. I was so happy that I was wrong.

His sound sort of sits between a spectrum that isn't too jazzy, but also isn't too R&Bish. It's a very nice balance. You can hear a little more of one or the other throughout the album. "Easily", for example, has such a deep pocket that it's almost impossible to not make unattractive faces while listening to it. "Like Someone in Love" has more of his jazz influence cutting through with harmonies that'll make you feel like you're enjoying a single-malt scotch at a lounge in New York.

_"It's been a while since 21, I still feel the same"_

Now we get to some of the deeper parts, at least for me. "Home" was a song that I listened to on repeat almost everyday during a time where it seemed like it also conveniently rained everyday. It was almost a routine that I would take a drive and play this song. Everything felt set in its rightful place.

_"But I only have myself to blame,_
_'Cause I still love you just the same"_


It's as if the songs followed almost in succession to what was going on in my life. Coincidence??? Yeah, probably. But in a time where I felt like I was dragged through the dirt, it's almost as if I had this album to express myself for me. 

"Just the Same" hits with a ferocity in emotion and in instrumentation; always ending with a standalone piano and vocal part of "cause I still love you just the same", as if to express a form of venting.

_"My fair-weather friend, I wish you could see,_
_He'll never love you quite like me"_

Dare I say more?

At first listen, "Fair-Weather Friend" was immense. There are so many things I could say about this song. The chorus has a progression that is just…perfect. Pair that up with a heart tugging falsetto and you have yourself a song that will make you **UGLY CRY**.

Most albums that I cherish have some deep connections to past memories or people. I'm sure that I'm definitely not alone in that regard since I assume a good amount of people enjoy music, not just for listening pleasures, but also for the complex range of emotions a three to four minute song can trigger. At least for me, I can almost predict the type of mood a song will put me in. Have I tapped into some greater power that I can control? Who knows! However, I tend to abuse it more than I probably should.

Most people don't like to feel sad. 
I purposely induce it on myself at times. 


I know what you're thinking; that is insane! Why would you ever do such a thing to yourself! I can explain.

I think it is absolutely beautiful that something as simple as a song, put together by someone that you've never met, can move you to tears. Whether they are tears of joy or of pain, it doesn't matter. *IT MOVES YOU.* I think that is way more insane than me manipulating my emotions. Heh. I like to feel. It makes you...well...feel alive. Am I rambling? Yes.

ANYWAYS, GO LISTEN TO THIS ALBUM IN ITS ENTIRETY. YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE IT. K LOVE YOU BYE.
