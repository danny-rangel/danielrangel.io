This project was a quick experimentation with the new React Hooks. I'm using [Dan Abramov's](https://github.com/gaearon) useInterval hook to time the API request every second. My useSubCount hook fetches the needed information by just supplying a username or channel id for the input. The default input is Pewdiepie's sub count, thereby solidifying this as the most millenial project I've made.
