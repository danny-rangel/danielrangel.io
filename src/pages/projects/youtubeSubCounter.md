This project was a quick experimentation with the new React Hooks. I'm using [Dan Abramov's](https://github.com/gaearon) useInterval hook to time the API request every second. My useSubCount hook very easily fetches the needed information with just supplying a username for the input.

*Note: Fetching sometimes doesn't return a value because Youtube profiles can have that information as private*
