This was a quick app I made that performs some calculations related to hard disk drives.

This includes calculating the average rotational delay, clusters needed for a file, time for reading a cluster,
read times, etc.

<div 
    style=
    "overflow: auto; 
    -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch; 
    width: 100%; 
    height: 440px;
    border-radius: 4px;"
>
    <iframe style="
        height: 400px;
        max-width: 600px;
        width: 100%;
        border-radius: 4px;
        border: none;" 
        src="https://hddcalculations.netlify.com">
    </iframe>
</div>
