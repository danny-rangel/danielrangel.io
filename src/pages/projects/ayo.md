Ayo is a chat application created with React and Firebase. I've been messing around a lot with websockets recently and was pleasantly surprised to use some of Firebase's built-in functionalities that enable realtime updating of data. Loving Firebase so far! The UI was made using [React-95](https://github.com/arturbien/React95) UI components that'll give some of us a nostalgic feeling.

Log in on two seperate windows with the demo below and try sending yourself messages!

<div 
    style=
    "overflow: auto; 
    -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch; 
    width: 100%; 
    height: 540px;
    border-radius: 4px;"
>
    <iframe style="
        height: 500px;
        width: 100%;
        border-radius: 4px;
        border: none;" 
        src="https://ayo-app-6783b.firebaseapp.com">
    </iframe>
</div>
