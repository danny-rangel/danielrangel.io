Ayo is a chat application created with React and Firebase. I've been messing around a lot with websockets recently and was pleasantly surprised to use some of Firebase's built-in functionalities that enable realtime updating of data. Loving Firebase so far! The UI was made using [React-95](https://github.com/arturbien/React95) UI components that'll give some of us a nostalgic feeling.
